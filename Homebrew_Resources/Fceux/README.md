Fceux 
=======

Fceux doesn’t support Lua5.2 right now, but there has been a large discussion about doing so over at Fceux’s SF page, [here](http://sourceforge.net/p/fceultra/bugs/569/?page=1).

Uploaded here is the proposed patch by Ryan W. Moore that enables Fceux to compile using Lua5.2, tested on Ubuntu. I will shortly test the script out on OS X and see if it works on this platform as well.
