Chromium
=======

The world’s laziest fix for the POODLE vulnerability in Chromium by exercising development flags. I’ve just replaced the Chromium icon in my dock with this for now. It works. It ain’t pretty, and it’s stupidly simple, but it works. It’s just a one-line bash script.

If you wanna be as lazy as me, here’s me facilitating that. Yay for supreme laziness.
